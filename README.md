# Matplotlib Subplots Demo

This project demonstrates how to create a 2x2 grid of subplots using Matplotlib and NumPy, with each plot uniquely labeled and color-coded. The labels range from "A" to "D", and each plot is colored in red, green, blue, or black.

## Project Overview

The project visualizes random data using `matplotlib.pyplot`'s subplots functionality, making it easy to display multiple plots within the same figure. The subplots are titled "Plot A", "Plot B", "Plot C", and "Plot D", and each plot is styled with unique colors and a legend.

## Features
- 2x2 grid of subplots.
- Random data is plotted in each subplot.
- Each plot is labeled from "A" to "D".
- Unique colors for each plot: red, green, blue, and black.
- Legends added to each subplot.
- Main title for the entire figure.
